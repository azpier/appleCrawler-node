# appleCrawler

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grimmer0125/appleCrawler-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grimmer0125/appleCrawler-node)

Use "request" + "cheerio" to grab the content of http://www.apple.com/tw/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac, then use Line to broadcast the information. Actually this project is more like a scraper but not change the repo name to keep the consistence.

## Steps for development:

1. (optional) Install the latest version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Go to the project root folder.
3. Type "npm install" to install npm dependencies.
4. Run "npm start" to launch the application.
